Garmin
======

Let's face it: Garmin Connect doesn't have the most exquisite statistics to slice up your running data. This is an attempt to bridge that gap between the raw data and seeing the long (and possibly short) term trends.

Ultimately I'd like to make this into a web service, but it depends *entirely* on Garmin Connect's website: if they change how forms are submitted, the data-scraping portion of this service will break until I can refactor my scripts to emulate it again.
